# OperationalTransform
C library for a generic operational transform collaboration system. Operations provided pertain to basic document editing.

## Using the engine
To use the engine, become familiar with the `struct message` format found in `ops.h`.

### Server
The server-side engine consumes operations from clients.
It produces transformed operations that should be broadcast to all clients, including the originating client.

### Client
The client-side engine consumes operations from the local environment (user, machine, etc.), as well as from the server.
For operations generated locally, we need to tell the engine by setting `pid` to -1.
For operations generated by the server, the `pid` field remains unchanged.

The client-side engine produces both operations to be sent to the server and operations to be applied locally.
Operations intended to be applied by the client are indicated by `pid = -1`.
Otherwise, the operation is intended for the server.

## Modularity
This implementation was designed to be adaptable.
Although the current `ops.*` files implement basic document operations (INSERT,REMOVE), the `ot-{client,server}` code is agnostic and the operations can be easily swapped out.
